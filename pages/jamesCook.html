        The Lambton Wing of the hotel is currently being upgraded. Renovations are being completed in stages (3 – 4 floors at a time) between the hours of 8.30am – 5pm, in order to minimise guest disruption. The following room types are currently unavailable during the first stages of the refurbishment: Club King Rooms, One Bedroom Suites, Spa Suite, plus the Executive Club Lounge. Work is not expected to impact the hotel's restaurant or conference facilities and is due for completion in 2020.
